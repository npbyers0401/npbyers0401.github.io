# README

Here you can find the files for my personal Github Pages site. This site was forked from the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template.

From their site:

"A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License."
