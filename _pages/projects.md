## Master's Project

### ECfAIR: A Semi-Supervised Classification Method for Email Collections

**Description:**

ECfAIR - (**E** mail **C** lassification **f** or **A** rchival and **I** nstitutional **R** epositories)

For my master's paper I will build a tool to evaluate a semi-supervised "ensemble" classification method for use with large email collections. If successful, this method could be integrated into existing digital archives systems for the appraisal of email collections.

**Topics:** Machine Learning, Digital Archives, Text Mining

**Tools:** Python (Scikit Learn)

**Date:** 2019-2020

## Work / Side Projects

### bibrepbuilder

**Description:**

A Python-based tool for compiling multi-publication bibliometric reports using Web of Science (WoS) data

This tool was designed to produce short, descriptive bibliometric reports for sets of scholarly publications. It mimics some of the functionality of the Web of Science web interface but allows for easier manipulation and use of data and charts. The tool was designed to give researchers an accessible starting point for understanding the reach and impact of their publications or those of their team or organization. Alternatively, the tool can be used by librarians producing reports for patrons within their institution.

The tool accepts as input a single WoS file and uses several Clarivate APIs to compile an Excel report.

**Topics:** Bibliometrics

**Tools:** Python (pandas, tkinter, xlsxwriter)

**Date:** 2019-2020
