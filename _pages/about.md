I'm a master's student in the School of Library and Information Science at UNC Chapel Hill. Coming from a history-oriented background, I'm interested in bridging the gap between the humanities and more technical fields. It's probably no surprise then that my professional path finds me at an intersection of library science and data science. I'm especially interested in machine learning applications that can help us to better understand large textual corpora. I also enjoy working on new projects and helping others to complete their own.

This professional page is meant to demonstrate some of the projects I've worked on as a student, as a professional, and as a hobbyist.
