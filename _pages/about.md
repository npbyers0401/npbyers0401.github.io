I am a master's student in the School of Information and Library Science at UNC Chapel Hill. Coming from a history-oriented background, I am interested in bridging the gap between the humanities and more technical fields. As a result, my professional path finds me at an intersection of library science and data science. I am especially interested in research involving machine learning applications that can help us to better understand large textual corpora. Aside from the above activities, my professional interests include library systems, technical instruction, software development, and technical writing. I enjoy working on new projects and helping others to complete their own.

This professional page is meant to demonstrate some of the projects I have worked on as a student, as a professional, and as a hobbyist.
